# meridian-tiingo

@AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is canonical: what this plugin is and the rules it keeps, how to
build its pages with the plugin UI kit, and the live loop. The loop is also
the `develop-live` skill, under `.claude/skills/`, for when a session is
asked to change the plugin and see it running. `CLAUDE.local.md` and
`.claude/settings.local.json` are one person's own, and git-ignored.

In the Open Meridian workspace, the workspace's own `CLAUDE.md` and
meridian-design's plan for this plugin (`plans/the-lake-prices-the-book.md`,
row 14) come first. **Never handle a Tiingo token**: the person who holds the
Tiingo account enters it as the plugin's secret setting, themselves.
